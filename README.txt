An innovative stacked ensemble model, combining the strengths of multiple regression algorithms, was developed to predict income across diverse professions. 
Trained on the RoS_sample_submission dataset, this model achieved a remarkable R² of 0.8761, significantly outperforming individual models. 
This research demonstrates the potential of stacked ensembles for complex regression problems.
